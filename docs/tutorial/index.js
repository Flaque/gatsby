Weâ€™re so happy you decided to try using Gatsby. This tutorial has five parts that'll walk you from getting started developing and building Gatsby sites to deploying a finished and polished high performance static PWA.
     
This tutorial is for *everyone*! You do not need to be a programmer or React.js expert. We'll walk you through things.

0. [Programming basics (Part Zero)](/tutorial/part-zero/): If you are new to programming, here's an introduction to some basics like terminal,  code editors, and browser consoles.
1. [Introduction to basics of Gatsby (Part One)](/tutorial/part-one/) - Starting new projects, developing, and deploying sites.
2. [Introduction to using CSS in Gatsby (Part Two)](/tutorial/part-two/): Explore libraries like Typography.js and CSS Modules.
3. [Explore building nested layouts in Gatsby (Part Three)](/tutorial/part-three/). Layouts are sections of your site that are reused across multiple pages like headers and footers.
4. [Learn how to work with Gatsby]((/tutorial/part-four/))'s data layer in Part Four. Explore source & transformer plugins. Get introduced to programmatic pages and how to write GraphQL queries. In this part of the tutorial we'll build a bare-bones markdown blog.
